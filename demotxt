2. Run the app locally using `ng serve --open`
3. Create a new S3 bucket, and keep public access turned off.
4. Build the Angular app using `ng build`
5. Upload published content in the S3 bucket.
6. Create a CloudFront distribution.
7. Add error pages to handle 404 and 403 error codes for dynamic routes.
8. Verify the Angular app using the CloudFront URL.
9. Thatâ€™s all ðŸ™‚
